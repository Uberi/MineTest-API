Material is sourced mainly from [api.minetest.net](http://api.minetest.net) and the Lua API documentation included with MineTest.

Some of that material was further sourced from Jeija's [modding tutorial](http://multa.bugs3.com/minetest/tutorial/englishEN.html).

Significant amounts of new material has been added by Anthony Zhang (Uberi).
